Description

cfRegex is a project to provide a complete set of regex functionality

easy for everyone to use.

It provides a Regex object, cfregex tag, and a selection of functions,
all designed to be used instead of the existing regex functions.

For full details of what is provided see docs.pdf for documentation.

* ColdFusion 9 and above.
* OpenBD 2.x and above.
